# Project number 2 : Debug a Java application
## Overview
this project is made to read a file of symptoms and rewrite them in another file respecting the alphabetical order and displaying the number of occurrences for each symptom.To carry out this project I had to correct the work of another developer by removing unnecessary comments, by creating new interfaces and new classes and by modifying the Main class of the "AnalytricsCounter" file.<br />
Note that this program is extensible given that it can take other data sources by simply adding an implementation of "reader" and "writer".
